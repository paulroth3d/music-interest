Simple place to collaborate on music ideas

## MuseScore can be found here:

https://musescore.org/

NOTE: there are two sites, and this can cause confusion:

* there is a paid / supported version ending in `.com`: https://musescore.com/
* and the open source verrsion ending in `.org`: https://musescore.org/

Files in `museScore` are settings

Files in `drums` are those we care about
  (`.mscz` are museScore version 3 files)
